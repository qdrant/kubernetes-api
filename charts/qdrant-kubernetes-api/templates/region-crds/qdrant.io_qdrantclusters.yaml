                      UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods
                      should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,
                      as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                      Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                      If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                      which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                      IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                      but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                      disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                      Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                      AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                      but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                      of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                      pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                      Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                      Additional policies may be added in the future.
                      Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                      if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                        to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                        for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                        MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                        Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                        be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                        This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                      description: |-
                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                    minDomains:
                      description: |-
                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                        of pods into each bucket.
                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                        And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                          skew.
                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
